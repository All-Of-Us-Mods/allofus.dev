  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 21st, 2025</p>

  <p>
    All Of Us Mods ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
    explains how information is handled when you use our Android application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect or store personal information directly on our own servers.
    However, the app integrates third-party services provided by Google that may
    collect limited information automatically in order to function properly.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
  <p>
    Our app displays advertisements using Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use
    information such as device identifiers, IP address, advertising ID, and
    interaction data in order to provide and measure ads, including personalized
    or non-personalized ads depending on your device settings and region.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device’s ad
    settings.
  </p>

  <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use Firebase Crashlytics to help identify and fix app crashes and stability
    issues. Crashlytics may collect technical information such as device type,
    operating system version, app version, crash logs, and diagnostic data.
    This information is used solely to improve app performance and reliability.
  </p>

  <h3>Other Google Services</h3>
  <p>
    Our app may also rely on standard Google Play services for core functionality,
    such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Sign-In (if enabled)</li>
    <li>Google Play Games services (cloud saves, achievements, or progress)</li>
    <li>Install metrics and basic usage statistics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These services may collect anonymous or aggregated data in accordance with
    Google’s policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information on how Google handles data, please review the
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Any cloud-based game or app data is stored and managed by Google services.
    We do not operate our own backend servers for storing personal user data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. Data may be
    processed by Google solely as part of the services described above and in
    accordance with their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not knowingly directed toward children under the age of 13.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe
    such information has been collected, please contact us so we can take
    appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>6. GDPR Privacy Rights (EEA Residents)</h2>
<p>
  If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data
  protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
</p>

<p>
  Depending on your location and circumstances, you may have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access the personal data that is processed about you</li>
  <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data</li>
  <li>Object to or restrict the processing of your data</li>
  <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>
  <li>Request data portability</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Please note that we do not directly collect or control personal data ourselves.
  Any data processing related to advertising, analytics, or crash reporting is
  handled by Google through services such as AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics.
</p>

<p>
  To exercise your rights regarding data processed by Google, please refer to
  Google’s privacy controls and policies:
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

  <h2>7. CCPA Privacy Rights (California Residents)</h2>
<p>
  If you are a California resident, you have rights under the California Consumer
  Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information is
  collected, used, or disclosed, and the right to request deletion of personal
  information.
</p>

<p>
  We do not sell personal information. However, our app uses third-party services
  such as Google AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics, which may collect certain
  information as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
  California residents have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Request disclosure of the categories of personal information collected</li>
  <li>Request deletion of personal information</li>
  <li>Opt out of the sale of personal information (if applicable)</li>
  <li>Not be discriminated against for exercising privacy rights</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Because we do not directly store or manage personal data, requests related to
  data collected by Google services should be directed to Google using their
  privacy tools and policies.
</p>

<p>
  For more information, please review the
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

  You may also contact us if you have questions regarding your CCPA rights.
