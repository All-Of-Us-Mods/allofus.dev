    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 22, 2025</p>

    <p>
      All Of Us Mods ("we", "our", or "us") operates the All Of Us Mods Android application
      known as Starlight. This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is processed when
      you use the app, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      and other applicable privacy laws.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller responsible for processing your personal data is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>All Of Us Mods</strong><br>
      Individual developer<br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:dev.aou.starlight@gmail.com">dev.aou.starlight@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data Is Collected</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Data You Provide</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose to sign in using itch.io OAuth, basic account identifiers provided
      by itch.io may be processed for authentication purposes. We do not operate our own
      user account system and do not store passwords.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the app, the following data may be processed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An anonymous, app-generated tracking identifier used solely to count content downloads</li>
      <li>Technical data such as app version, device type, and operating system version</li>
      <li>Crash and diagnostic data collected via Firebase Crashlytics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The anonymous tracking identifier is generated on installation and can be reset
      by clearing the app's data. It is not linked to your real-world identity.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Data Is Collected</h2>
    <p>
      Data is collected when you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app to download content from our backend server</li>
      <li>Use the app to connect to multiplayer servers</li>
      <li>Sign in using itch.io OAuth</li>
      <li>Use the app while crash reporting or diagnostics are enabled</li>
      <li>View or interact with advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Legal Basis (GDPR Art. 6)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Content delivery and download counting</td>
        <td>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Crash reporting and diagnostics</td>
        <td>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Non-personalized advertising</td>
        <td>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Personalized advertising</td>
        <td>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OAuth authentication</td>
        <td>Contractual necessity (Art. 6(1)(b))</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Advertising is always displayed in the app. Users in applicable regions are
      asked to provide consent for the use of personal data for personalized
      advertising via Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP).
    </p>

    <p>
      If consent for personalized advertising is not granted or is withdrawn,
      non-personalized ads will continue to be shown. Consent choices can be
      changed at any time through the in-app consent settings or applicable
      device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>
      The app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Advertising is always
      shown in the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on your consent choices, AdMob may process personal data such as
      device identifiers, IP address, and interaction data to provide personalized
      advertisements. If consent is not provided, only non-personalized
      advertisements will be shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consent for personalized advertising is managed using Google's User Messaging
      Platform (UMP).
    </p>

    <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
    <p>
      Firebase Crashlytics is used to collect crash reports and diagnostic data to
      improve app stability and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information on Google's data practices, see:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>itch.io OAuth</h3>
    <p>
      If you sign in using itch.io, authentication data is processed by itch.io in
      accordance with their <a href="https://itch.io/docs/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">privacy policy.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>InnerSloth</h3>
    <p>
      The app integrates with InnerSloth services for gameplay features related to
      Among Us. For more information, please refer to InnerSloth's
      <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Game Server Hosters</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect to a multiplayer match, the privacy policies of the respective
      server operators apply. The app shares your authentication details with these
      servers. These are the privacy policies of the server operators we include
      by default: 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>InnerSloth: <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li>Miniduikboot: To Be Announced</li>
      <li>NikoCat233: <a href="https://au.niko233.me/policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Backend Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      Content delivery is handled by a backend server hosted with Hetzner in the United States,
      with Cloudflare (US East) acting as a reverse proxy. The backend does not log IP addresses,
      and IP logging is disabled at the proxy level.
    </p>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Because the app operates internationally, personal data may be processed outside
      the European Economic Area (EEA). Where applicable, such transfers are protected
      by appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
      described in this policy. Retention periods for data processed by third-party
      services are governed by their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EEA, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your personal data</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
      <li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
      <li>Request data portability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
      authority.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The app is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect
      personal data from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
      within the app or on our website, and the effective date will be updated.
    </p>
