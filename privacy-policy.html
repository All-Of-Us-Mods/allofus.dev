    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 22, 2025</p>

    <p>
      All Of Us Mods ("we", "our", or "us") operates the All Of Us Mods Android application.
      This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is processed when you use the app,
      in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other
      applicable privacy laws.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller responsible for processing your personal data is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>All Of Us Mods</strong><br>
      Individual developer<br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:dev.aou.starlight@gmail.com">dev.aou.starlight@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data Is Collected</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Data You Provide</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose to sign in using itch.io OAuth, basic account identifiers provided
      by itch.io may be processed for authentication purposes. We do not operate our own
      user account system and do not store passwords.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the app, the following data may be processed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An anonymous, app-generated tracking identifier used solely to count content downloads</li>
      <li>Technical data such as app version, device type, and operating system version</li>
      <li>Crash and diagnostic data collected via Firebase Crashlytics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The anonymous tracking identifier is generated on installation and can be reset
      by clearing the app’s data. It is not linked to your real-world identity.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Data Is Collected</h2>
    <p>
      Data is collected when you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app to download content from our backend server</li>
      <li>Sign in using itch.io OAuth</li>
      <li>Use the app while crash reporting or diagnostics are enabled</li>
      <li>View or interact with advertisements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Legal Basis (GDPR Art. 6)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Content delivery and download counting</td>
        <td>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Crash reporting and diagnostics</td>
        <td>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Advertising (AdMob)</td>
        <td>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OAuth authentication</td>
        <td>Contractual necessity (Art. 6(1)(b))</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time
      through in-app settings or your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>
      The app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Depending on your consent
      choices, AdMob may process device identifiers, IP address, and interaction data
      to provide personalized or non-personalized ads.
    </p>

    <h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
    <p>
      Firebase Crashlytics is used to collect crash reports and diagnostic data to
      improve app stability and performance.
    </p>

    <h3>itch.io OAuth</h3>
    <p>
      If you sign in using itch.io, authentication data is processed by itch.io in
      accordance with their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <p>

      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Backend Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      Content delivery is handled by a backend server hosted with Hetzner in the United States,
      with Cloudflare (US East) acting as a reverse proxy. The backend does not log IP addresses,
      and IP logging is disabled at the proxy level.
    </p>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Because the app operates internationally, personal data may be processed outside
      the European Economic Area (EEA). Where applicable, such transfers are protected
      by appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
      described in this policy. Retention periods for data processed by third-party
      services are governed by their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EEA, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your personal data</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
      <li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
      <li>Request data portability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
      authority.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The app is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect
      personal data from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
      within the app or on our website, and the effective date will be updated.
    </p>
